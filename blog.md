# It's a Blog's world

## Entry One: Dated Sunday Febuary Fifth.
I've got a project coming up. The project is simple. You know how when you run my scripts, it downloads the file? Well, I'm creating a solution. And yes, the methods for downloading it will be quite standard. The planned release is sometime in the next week or so. ThyCowLord, signing off.
