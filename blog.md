## Entry Four: Dated Monday February Sixth
It's complete! It's called nmp, you can find it [here].(https://github.com/ThyCowLord/nmp)
There are instructions, so go check that out. It works by taking the current time, taking another time, and doing a mathematical operation, and it has not produced the same number twice. However, if someone has the time right down to the microsecond, they may be able to steal the data. But, if you have someone standing over your shoulder, timing things to the microsecond, there's a bigger problem. 

## Entry Three: Dated Monday February Sixth
New project, truly random numbers library for python.

## Entry Two: Dated Sunday February Fifth
The project is completed, you can find it [here](https://thycowlord.github.io/pine). It's called Pine, and it has no bugs or issues I've discovered in testing. For the love of cows, don't run it on your main machine.


## Entry One: Dated Sunday February Fifth.
My current project is working on a python script, a script that every time you execute a command, it has a chance, set by the user, to __destroy the system__. How fun.
