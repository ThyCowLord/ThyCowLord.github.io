## Entry Seven: Dated Sunday March Fourth
CowCore has been developed. __It will not be released.__ The reason why? It's the engine I use for creating games.   
It's the engine my company uses. So shut up. It's closed source.


## Entry Six: Dated Tuesday February Seventh
A better way for acessing my projects has been released. You can find it [here](https://github.com/ThyCowLord/bw)


## Entry Five: Dated Monday February Sixth
Roses are red, violets are blue, I hate PHP, and so do you.


## Entry Four: Dated Monday February Sixth
It's complete! It's called nmp, you can find it [here](https://github.com/ThyCowLord/nmp).
There are instructions, so go check that out. It works by taking the current time, taking another time, and doing a mathematical operation, and it has not produced the same number twice, for obvious reasons.

## Entry Three: Dated Monday February Sixth
New project, truly random numbers library for python.

## Entry Two: Dated Sunday February Fifth
The project is completed, you can find it [here](https://thycowlord.github.io/pine). It's called Pine, and it has no bugs or issues I've discovered in testing. For the love of cows, don't run it on your main machine.


## Entry One: Dated Sunday February Fifth.
My current project is working on a python script, a script that every time you execute a command, it has a chance, set by the user, to __destroy the system__. How fun.
